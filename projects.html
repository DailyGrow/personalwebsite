            <h2>Software Design Recognition on Pest-infested Leaves</h2> 
            <ul>
                <li>Proposed a leaf wormhole reconstruction algorithm that utilized a VGG neural 
                    network and introduced wavelet transform to recognize damage on pest-infested 
                    leaves based on computer vision.
                </li>
                <li>Designed a leaf contour recognition algorithm with OpenCV to process leaf 
                    images and algorithm was used to accurately obtain the number and area of leaf 
                    worm spots.
                </li>
                <li>Developed a software using Qt, which included 3 functional modules and allowed 
                    users to quickly understand insect damage on typical leaves, with 95% accuracy
                </li>

            </ul>

            <h2>VizWiz-Image Captioning Challenge 2020</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Built a machine learning model to accurately predict and generate a suitable caption 
                    given an image
                </li>
                <li>
                    Extracted abstract features of the image based on the network of ResNet101 and added 
                    a soft attention mechanism to strengthen and suppress features, then input into the LSTM network for decoding.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Submitted the results to the competition leaderboard ranking in the top 50 out of over 250
                </li>
            <ul>

            <h2>Welfare Evaluation System of Caged Hens</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Created a caged hens welfare evaluation system based off of an unmanned inspection platform
                </li>
                <li>
                    Refactored software for a thermal image camera by using SDK, then utilizing FFmpeg to transmit image information 
                    to a remote terminal and designed an Android app to provide long-range control of an unmanned inspection platform.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Built a video player using PyQt to broadcast real-time images of chicken coops.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3D Car Racing Games Development</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Developed 3D Car Racing games, created realistic car models, and built a whole CG world with OpenGL
                </li>
                <li>
                    Designed and implemented multiple complex functions in game development such as NURBS curve modeling, real-time 
                    collision detection when roaming, complex light illumination model, complex material effects, etc.
                </li>
