        <ul><li>CS 5800</li>
            <p>
                Presents the mathematical techniques used for the design and analysis
                 of computer algorithms. Focuses on algorithmic design paradigms and 
                  for analyzing the correctness, time, and space complexity of algorithms. 
                  Topics may include asymptotic notation, recurrences, loop invariants, 
                  Hoare triples, sorting and searching, advanced data structures, lower 
                  bounds, hashing, greedy algorithms, dynamic programming, graph algorithms, 
                  and NP-completeness.
            </p>

                Introduces modern program design paradigms. Starts with functional program 
                design, introducing the notion of a design recipe. The latter consists of two 
                parts: a task organization (ranging from the description of data to the creation 
                of a test suite) and a data-oriented approach to the organization of programs 
                (ranging from atomic data to self-referential data definitions and functions as data). 
                The course then progresses to object-oriented design, explaining how it generalizes and 
                contrasts with functional design. In addition to studying program design, students also 
                have an opportunity to practice pair-programming and public code review techniques, as found 
                in industry today.

            <p>
                Focuses on mobile application development on a mobile phone or related platform. Discusses
                 memory management; user interface building, including both MVC principles and specific tools; 
                 touch events; data handling, including core data, SQL, XML, and JSON; network techniques and URL 
                 loading; and, finally, specifics such as GPS and motion sensing that may be dependent on the particular 
                 mobile platform. Students are expected to work on a project that produces a professional-quality mobile 
                 application and to demonstrate the application that they have developed. The instructor chooses a modern
                  mobile platform to be used in the course.
